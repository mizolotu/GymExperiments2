# stable-baselines-tf2
The original [stable-baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) repo only supports TF1.x.\
This repo makes a few modifications to make stable-baselines compatible with TF2.x while keeping the rest of the code logic intact.

## Features Introduced Not Exist In Stable Baselines
- L2 regularization in `PPO2`. Set L2 loss weight to zero if you want to turn off regularization.

## Installation Instruction
